=========================[FILES]=========================
P11.c  -  The brute force code counter for P1.1
P12.c  -  The Divide & Conquer code counter for P1.2
P21.c  -  The brute force code counter for P2.1
P22.c  -  The Divide & Conquer code counter for P2.2
P1.h   -  General code for both P11.c & P12.c (reading files, stopwatch)
P2.h   -  General code for both P21.c & P22.c (reading points, finding shortest path, stopwatch)

makefile    -  For making the programs
design.pdf  -  the algorithms analysis for P1.1, P1.2, P2.1 & P2.2


======================[HOW TO RUN]=======================
* To make all files, call `make`
* To make a specific program call `make P11` (works with P11, P12, P21 and P22)
* To run the program, call `./P11` after making (works with P11, P12, P21 and P22)


[P11 & P12]
When running P11 or P12, you will be prompted to enter the file name you want to read from
==============
> Enter File:
==============


After entering the file, the program will run and show you
the number of inversions & how long it took
==========================
> Time elapsed: _______ms
> Inversions: ___________
==========================



[P21 & P22]
When you run either P21 or P22, the convex hull will be calculated then you will
be able to enter the x & y coords for s1 & s2

===================
> Enter x for s1$ 
> Enter x for s1$ 
===================
