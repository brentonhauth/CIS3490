I have matched the output exactly like that in the guide.

=========================[FILES]=========================
P1.h   -  General code for both P11.c & P12.c (reading data, stopwatch)
P11.c  -  The brute force subset sum problem for P1.1
P12.c  -  The branch and bound subset sum problem for P1.2

P2.h   -  General code for P21.c & P22.c (reading data, stopwatch)
P21.c  -  The brute force job assignment problem for P2.1
P22.c  -  The branch and bound job assignment problem for P2.2

makefile    -  For making the programs

======================[HOW TO RUN]=======================
* To make all files, call `make`
* To make a specific program call `make P11` (works with P11, P12, P21 and P22)
* To run the program, call `./P11` after making (works with P11, P12, P21 and P22)
