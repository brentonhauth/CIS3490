P11.c  -  The brute force code interval counter for P1.1
P12.c  -  The presorted interval counter for P1.2

P2.h   -  General code for P21.c, P22.c & P23.c (reading points, creating shift tables, stopwatch)
P21.c  -  The brute force string match counter for P2.1
P22.c  -  The Horspool algorithm string match counter for P2.2
P23.c  -  The Boyer-Moore algorithm string match counter for P2.3

makefile    -  For making the programs

======================[HOW TO RUN]=======================
* To make all files, call `make`
* To make a specific program call `make P11` (works with P11, P12, P21, P22 and P23)
* To run the program, call `./P11` after making (works with P11, P12, P21, P22 and P23)


=======================[ANALYSIS]========================
[P11 & P12]
After running 10 trials for both P11 & P12, I found that P11 had
an average time of 8932.8ms (sd = 40.4) and P12 had an average
time of 2611.4ms (sd = 14.9). On average P12 was about 3.4x
faster than P11.

[COMPARING P21 TO P22]
When looking at the mean ratio of shifts to time between the brute force
algorithm (208466.56) and the Horspool algorithm (54652.30) we can see that
the brute force algorithm has a ratio that is approx. 3.8x larger than the
Horspool. Meaning that the Horspool algorithm is able to accomplish the same
utilizing less shifts in a smaller amount of time.

[COMPARING P21 TO P23]
When looking at the ratio between the Boyer-Moore algorithm (40276.36) and
the brute force algorithm (208466.56) we can see that the ratio of the brute
force is approx. 5.2x larger.
This is a much greater difference than how it compared to the Horspool algo.
Even though the brute force & Boyer-Moore had similar times for some of the
search patterns ("Guelph" had 14.7ms for both), it shows that the Boyer-Moore
algo. was able to the same thing with less shifts, and in most cases, resulted
in faster times.
